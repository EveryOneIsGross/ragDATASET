# rrrrrrrrag_dataset
The design docs for a synthetic rag dataset with an emphasis on reasoning stages. 

Create a synthetic dataset for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, plan for the following abstractions and components:

1. System Prompt:
   - Define a clear and concise system prompt that sets the context and goals for the conversation.
   - The system prompt should guide the LLM in generating appropriate responses.

2. Conversation Structure:
   - Determine the structure of the conversation, such as the number of turns, the roles of the participants (e.g., user and assistant), and the flow of the dialog.
   - Consider including different types of questions and responses to cover various scenarios.

3. Question and Answer Pairs:
   - Generate a diverse set of question and answer pairs that align with the conversation structure and system prompt.
   - Ensure that the questions cover a wide range of topics and varying levels of complexity.
   - The answers should be coherent, informative, and relevant to the corresponding questions.

4. Knowledge Source:
   - Build a search database or knowledge source that contains relevant information for the conversation topics.
   - The knowledge source can be a collection of documents, articles, or any other structured or unstructured data.
   - Ensure that the knowledge source is diverse and covers the necessary topics to support the generated conversations.

5. Query Rewriting:
   - Implement a mechanism to rewrite the user's queries or questions to improve the retrieval of relevant chunks from the knowledge source.
   - This can involve techniques like query expansion, synonyms, or semantic understanding to enhance the matching between the query and the knowledge source.

6. Chunk Retrieval:
   - Develop a retrieval system that can efficiently search and retrieve relevant chunks of information from the knowledge source based on the rewritten query.
   - The retrieval system should rank and select the most relevant chunks to be used as context for generating the responses.

7. Context Integration:
   - Design a way to integrate the retrieved chunks of context into the conversation flow.
   - The LLM should be able to effectively utilize the provided context to generate informed and coherent responses.
   - Consider techniques like attention mechanisms or context-aware architectures to incorporate the retrieved information.

8. Evaluation and Iteration:
   - Establish evaluation metrics to assess the quality and effectiveness of the generated conversations and retrieved context.
   - Iterate on the dataset generation process based on the evaluation results to refine and improve the system's performance.

To build a "mock" runtime pipeline, you can start by implementing the following steps:

1. Create a search database or knowledge source with a diverse set of information relevant to the conversation topics.

2. Develop a query rewriting module that takes the user's question as input and generates a rewritten query optimized for retrieval.

3. Implement a retrieval system that takes the rewritten query and searches the knowledge source to retrieve the most relevant chunks of context.

4. Use an LLM to generate question and answer pairs based on the system prompt, conversation structure, and retrieved context.

5. Integrate the retrieved context into the generated responses to ensure coherence and relevance.

6. Evaluate the generated conversations and retrieved context using suitable metrics and iterate on the process to improve the quality of the synthetic dataset.
